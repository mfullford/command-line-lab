This is a 999 line poem that focuses on two fictional men men that both author portions of it. The novel looks at many topics, the most apparent is death. Nabokov says that both characters end up dying - one while he is writing and the other after the novel is finished. Classically dark and beautiful - a solid read from old Vlad.
