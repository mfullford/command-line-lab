This is one of the creepiest books I have ever read. The language is absolutely beautiful and it actually gets you to the point where you understand and almost even sympathize with a man who is in love with a child. Totally eery, but very well done. The ending is a bit strange - the protagonist basically ends up shooting and killing his competition (also a total creep).
