This is the final love letter from Oscar Wilde to Lord Alfred Douglas. Both men were obsessed with beauty and wealth to a fault. They lived without guilt and in the end that is probably what did them in. It's a very comical letter, despite their situation, and compares Christ to a fellow artist and pokes fun at British hypocrisy. It was not published until well after Oscar had died.
