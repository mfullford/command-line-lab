This is a haunting ballad written by Keats about a knight and a beautiful woman. La belle, the woman, is a femme fatale. The ballad is about the pain and joys of love and can be interpreted in many different ways. It's a classic example of Keats and his romantic, purposeful, and admittedly slow writing.
