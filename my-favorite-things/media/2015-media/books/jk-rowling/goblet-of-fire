Okay so by now some crazy stuff has happened to the gang, but I enjoy this particular adventure because it's a change of pace. We have the tri wizard tournament which introduces us to new witches and wizards whaaaa pretty sweet. Also there's an incredibly awkward/dramatic school dance. Edward from Twilight dies and the kids realize their teacher is a disguised criminal who is hiding their real teacher in his trunk. Also, dragons.
