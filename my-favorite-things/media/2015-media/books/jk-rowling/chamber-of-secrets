This is arguably the best Harry Potter book - basically Harry becomes obsessed with a book that was written by his MORTAL NEMESIS unbeknownst to him. He opens the 'chamber of secrets' by accident and weird stuff starts happening. His friends investigate these strange occurences and ultimately they understand what's happening and they end up ruining the book using the tooth of a giant snake.
